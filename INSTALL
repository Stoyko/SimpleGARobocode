## Use In Robocode

1) Extract the contents of SimpleGARobocode
2) Open Robocode
3) Click the Options menu> Preferences
4) Open the page "Development Options"
5) Click the "Add", then open the directory bin / of the extract and add the results.
6) Click Finish.
7) Perform a New Battle manufacture, click menu Battle> New Battle.
8) Add MainRobot and a / some opponents (Suggested use Crazy).
9) Select Rules page.
10) Fill out the "1" on the Number of Rounds (MANDATORY! Counting system fitness scores can not be done between rounds).
11) Click the Start Battle


## File ga.txt

Each time round running, the robot will process ga.txt files stored in the directory bin / ps / ac / its / SimpleGARobocode / MainRobot.Data. It contains 16 pieces each having a population of 5 gnome for routine: run (), OnScanned (), OnHitByBullet (), OnHitByWall (), OnHitByRobot () along with a fitness value for each combination of the gnome. The robot will calculate all fitness for all populations prior to the crossover and mutation genome to the next generation.

## Disadvantages

* Sequence Genome still working on Naive, no special optimizations to improve performance fitness.
* There is no recording of the current generation number.
* It should be about 3 generations in order to beat Crazy (based on the results of our trial).

## Compilation Re Java Code

Provided a script called build-robot.bat (for Windows) and build-robot.sh (for Linux / Mac OS X) that can automatically recompile the code * .java from src into * .class file in bin. Before compiling, make sure robocode installed in C: \ robocode (on Windows) or ~ / robocode or directory Home / robocode (on Linux and Mac OS X) that can direct the Java classpath setting jar file robocode / libs / robocode.jar.

To run the script:
* Double-click on Windows (make sure the JDK bin into the system variable PATH)
* Open a terminal, point (cd) to the extracted directory, run "./build-robot.sh" (without the quotes) on Linux / Mac OS X.

CAUTION: The robot has a few number of classes that are related to each other. Compilation directly through Robocode application can not be done because it can not compile a lot of class time.
